# DFLib

DFLib ("DataFrame Library") is a lightweight pure Java implementation of a common `DataFrame` data structure. 
DataFrames exist in Python (pandas), R, Spark and other languages and frameworks. DFLib's DataFrame is specifically 
intended for Java and JVM languages.

With DataFrame API, you get essentially the same data manipulation capabilities you may be used to in SQL (such as 
joins, etc.), only you apply them in-memory and over dynamically defined "tables". While SQL is "declarative", 
`DataFrame` allows step-by-step transformations that are somewhat easier to understand and much easier to compose. 

`DataFrame` is extremely versatile and can be used to model a variety of data tasks. ETL, log analysis, spreadsheets 
processing are just some of the examples. DFLib comes with connectors for a variety of data formats: 
CSV, Excel, RDBMS, Avro, JSON and can be easily adapted to any other formats (e.g. web-service-based ones like 
Google Sheets, etc.)

video still demonstrates the idea of the project...
